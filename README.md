# Project_DriveReader
 
This project aims to read a drive folder and categorize the folders and files. After doing so, it will sort the data related to files in a database. 

Setup includes creating a file `authorized.json` with `author` as key and list as its value with users names in string format. This allows the program to identify registered users and lets them run the program.
